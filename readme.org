Erlang wrapper for Binn Serialisation.

https://github.com/liteserver/binn/blob/master/spec.md

Please note that this project is a dependency for other projects,
currently the datastore project.  Deleting this project will break this.

This is a partial implementation of the spec, receiving a list of
basic types into Erlang.  This was all that was required for the
project I was working on at the time.

Reasons why this partial project has been exported to github:
1) It provides useful functionality
2) It is an important part of another project
3) It could be useful to others
